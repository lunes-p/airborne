SORRY, IT'S BROKEN 😭

This project was created from [DisconnectAppNetwork](https://github.com/DevelopCubeLab/DisconnectAppNetwork). 🥰

The jailed Asphalt 8 v2.6.0 iOS (non-arcade ver from 2016) tweak I tried to make.

You can view the [report](REPORT.md) from my various attempts at hacking Asphalt 8. <u>**I still managed to hack Asphalt in the end.**</u> Get yourself a decrypted ipa and a hex editor!
